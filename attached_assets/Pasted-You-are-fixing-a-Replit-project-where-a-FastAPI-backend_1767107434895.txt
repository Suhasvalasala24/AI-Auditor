You are fixing a Replit project where a FastAPI backend exists
but is NOT accessible publicly because a frontend router is being served instead.

Current situation:
- Project contains both frontend (client/) and backend (backend/)
- FastAPI backend runs successfully with Uvicorn
- Public URL shows: "404 Page Not Found – Did you forget to add the page to the router?"
- /docs also returns 404
- This means Replit is serving the frontend, not FastAPI

GOAL:
Expose the FastAPI backend as the public web server so that:
/docs loads Swagger UI
API endpoints are accessible
Frontend is ignored for now

--------------------------------------------
REQUIRED FIXES (DO NOT ADD FEATURES)
--------------------------------------------

1. Update the Replit run command so FastAPI is the ONLY public server

Create or update the `.replit` file at project root to contain EXACTLY:

run = "uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000"

2. Ensure FastAPI app is correctly defined

Verify that `backend/main.py` contains a FastAPI app object named `app`,
for example:

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}

Do NOT rename the app variable.

3. Do NOT serve frontend

- Do NOT run npm, vite, or react
- Do NOT serve index.html
- Do NOT proxy frontend routes
- Ignore client/ directory completely

4. Restart behavior

After changes:
- Stop the current Replit run
- Restart the Repl
- Uvicorn must bind to 0.0.0.0:8000

--------------------------------------------
EXPECTED RESULT
--------------------------------------------

When opening:
https://<replit-public-url>/docs

You must see:
- Swagger UI
- FastAPI logo
- All backend endpoints

Opening `/` may still show 404 — this is acceptable.

--------------------------------------------
CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------------------
- Do NOT merge frontend and backend
- Do NOT add reverse proxies
- Do NOT change backend logic
- Fix routing only

This prompt is ONLY to expose FastAPI correctly.
